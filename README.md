## Fear of HEIGHTS

As many of you know, different fears can be treated by _exposure therapy_.

The project consists of a few stages that will help examine patients with fear of heights. Those stages are based on different situations that can cause anxiety. The first stage is supposed to focus on anticipation of the feared situation. The next one is where the actual fear should start manifesting. The patient will be set in a safe environment (an elevator) that will start moving upward, stopping at different floors. The last stage represents the top of the building.

While outside, the patient will be able to look and walk around.
While inside the elevator, the patient will be able to choose at what floor he will want to go (from 1 to 7). Going down and stopping the elevator at any point is possible.
While on top of the building, the patient will be able to walk around and takehis time appoaching the edge.

Tip: Throwing donuts will also be possible at the lasst stage (eating something sweet can decrease fear levels).
