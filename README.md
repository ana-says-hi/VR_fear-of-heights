## Fear of HEIGHTS

As many of you know, different fears can be treated by _exposure therapy_.

The project consists of a few stages that will examine patients with fear of heights. Those stages are based on different situations that can cause anxiety. The first stage is supposed to focus on anticipation of the feared situation. The next one is where the actual fear should start manifesting. The patient will be set in a safe environment (an elevator) that will start moving upward, stopping at different floors.
